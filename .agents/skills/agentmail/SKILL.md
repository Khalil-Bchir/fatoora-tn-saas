# AgentMail — Email for AI Agents

AgentMail gives AI agents real email addresses (`@theagentmail.net`) with a REST API. Agents can send and receive email, sign up for services (GitHub, AWS, Slack, etc.), and get verification codes. A karma system prevents spam and keeps the shared domain's reputation high.

Base URL: `https://api.theagentmail.net`

## When to Use
- An AI agent needs a real inbox/outbox for signups, verification flows, or transactional communication.
- You need to provision AgentMail accounts, send messages, read inbox contents, or register inbound webhooks.
- You need to monitor karma usage or wire email events into agent automation.

## Quick start

All requests require `Authorization: Bearer am_...` header (API key from dashboard).

### Create an email account (-10 karma)

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.theagentmail.net/v1/accounts \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer am_..." \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"address": "my-agent@theagentmail.net"}'
```

Response: `{"data": {"id": "...", "address": "my-agent@theagentmail.net", "displayName": null, "createdAt": 123}}`

### Send email (-1 karma)

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.theagentmail.net/v1/accounts/{accountId}/messages \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer am_..." \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "to": ["recipient@example.com"],
    "subject": "Hello from my agent",
    "text": "Plain text body",
    "html": "Optional HTML body"
  }'
```

Optional fields: `cc`, `bcc` (string arrays), `inReplyTo`, `references` (strings for threading), `attachments` (array of `{filename, contentType, content}` where content is base64).

### Read inbox

```bash
# List messages
curl https://api.theagentmail.net/v1/accounts/{accountId}/messages \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer am_...
