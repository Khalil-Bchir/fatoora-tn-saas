# AgentPhone

AgentPhone is an API-first telephony platform for AI agents. Give your agents phone numbers, voice calls, and SMS — all managed through a simple API.

## When to Use
- Use when the user wants to create or manage AI phone agents, voice agents, or telephony automations
- Use when the user needs to buy, assign, release, or inspect phone numbers tied to an agent workflow
- Use when the user wants to place outbound calls, inspect transcripts, or send and receive SMS through AgentPhone
- Use when the user is configuring webhooks, hosted voice mode, or account-level usage for AgentPhone
- Use only with explicit user intent before actions that spend money, send messages, place calls, or release phone numbers

## How It Works

AgentPhone lets you create AI agents that can make and receive phone calls and SMS messages. Here's the full lifecycle:

1. You sign up at [agentphone.to](https://agentphone.to) and get an API key
2. You create an **Agent** — this is the AI persona that handles calls and messages
3. You buy a **Phone Number** and attach it to the agent
4. You configure a **Webhook** (for custom logic) or use **Hosted Mode** (built-in LLM handles the conversation)
5. Your agent can now make outbound calls, receive inbound calls, and send/receive SMS
