# Acceptance Orchestrator

## Overview

Orchestrate coding work as a state machine that ends only when acceptance criteria are verified with evidence or the task is explicitly escalated.

Core rule: **do not optimize for "code changed"; optimize for "DoD proven".**

## When to Use
- The task already has an issue or clear acceptance criteria and should run end-to-end with minimal human re-intervention.
- You need structured handoff across implementation, review, deployment, and final verification.
- You want explicit stop conditions and escalation instead of silent partial completion.

## Required Sub-Skills

- `create-issue-gate`
- `closed-loop-delivery`
- `verification-before-completion`

Optional supporting skills:
- `deploy-dev`
- `pr-watch`
- `pr-review-autopilot`
- `git-ship`

## Inputs

Require these inputs:
- issue id or issue body
- issue status
- acceptance criteria (DoD)
- target environment (`dev` default)

Fixed defaults:
- max iteration rounds = `2`
- PR review polling = `3m -> 6m -> 10m`

## State Machine

- `intake`
- `issue-gated`
- `executing`
- `review-loop`
- `deploy-verify`
- `accepted`
- `escalated`

## Workflow

1. **Intake**
   - Read issue and extract task goal + DoD.

2. **Issue gate**
   - Use `create-issue-gate` logic.
   - If issue is not `ready` or execution gate is not `allowed`, stop immediately.
   - Do not implement anything while issue remains `draft`.

3. **Execute**
   - Hand off to `closed-loop-delivery` for implementation and local verification.

4. **Review loop**
   - If PR feedback is relevant, batch polling windows as:
     - wait `3m`
     - then `6m`
     - then `10m`
   - After the `10m` round, stop waiting and process all visible comments toge
