# Frontend Expert

Modern React/TypeScript development patterns for high-performance applications.

## 🎯 Overview

This skill provides comprehensive guidelines for building production-grade React applications with:
- **Suspense-first architecture** - No loading spinners, no early returns
- **Type-safe patterns** - Strict TypeScript, no `any` types
- **Performance by default** - Lazy loading, memoization, cache strategies
- **Organized structure** - Feature-based directory organization

## 📋 Quick Start: Component Checklist

```markdown
- [ ] Use `React.FC` pattern with TypeScript
- [ ] Lazy load if heavy component: `React.lazy(() => import())`
- [ ] Wrap in `` for loading states
- [ ] Use `useSuspenseQuery` for data fetching
- [ ] Import aliases: `@/`, `~types`, `~components`, `~features`
- [ ] Styles: Inline if 100 lines
- [ ] Use `useCallback` for event handlers passed to children
- [ ] Default export at bottom
- [ ] No early returns with loading spinners
- [ ] Use `useMuiSnackbar` for user notifications
```

## 📋 Quick Start: Feature Checklist

```markdown
- [ ] Create `features/{feature-name}/` directory
- [ ] Create subdirectories: `api/`, `components/`, `hooks/`, `helpers/`, `types/`
- [ ] Create API service file: `api/{feature}Api.ts`
- [ ] Set up TypeScript types in `types/`
- [ ] Create route in `routes/{feature-name}/index.tsx`
- [ ] Lazy load feature components
- [ ] Use Suspense boundaries
- [ ] Export public API from feature `index.ts`
```

## 🧩 Import Aliases

| Alias | Resolves To | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| `@/` | `src/` | `import { apiClient } from '@/lib/apiClient'` |
| `~types` | `src/types` | `import type { User } from '~typ
