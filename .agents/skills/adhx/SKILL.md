# ADHX - X/Twitter Post Reader

Fetch any X/Twitter post as structured JSON for analysis using the ADHX API.

## Overview

ADHX provides a free API that returns clean JSON for any X post, including full long-form article content. This is far superior to scraping or browser-based approaches for LLM consumption. Works with regular tweets and full X Articles.

## When to Use This Skill

- Use when a user shares an X/Twitter link and wants to read, analyze, or summarize the post
- Use when you need structured data from an X/Twitter post (author, engagement, content)
- Use when working with long-form X Articles that need full content extraction

## API Endpoint

```
https://adhx.com/api/share/tweet/{username}/{statusId}
```

## URL Patterns

Extract `username` and `statusId` from any of these URL formats:

| Format | Example |
|--------|---------|
| `x.com/{user}/status/{id}` | `https://x.com/dgt10011/status/2020167690560647464` |
| `twitter.com/{user}/status/{id}` | `https://twitter.com/dgt10011/status/2020167690560647464` |
| `adhx.com/{user}/status/{id}` | `https://adhx.com/dgt10011/status/2020167690560647464` |

## Workflow

When a user shares an X/Twitter link:

1. **Parse the URL** to extract `username` and `statusId` from the path segments
2. **Fetch the JSON** using curl:
```bash
curl -s "https://adhx.com/api/share/tweet/{username}/{statusId}"
```
3. **Use the structured response** to answer the user's question (summarize, analyze, extract key points, etc.)

## Response Schema

```json
{
  "id": "statusId",
  "url": "original x.com URL",
  "text": "short-form tweet text (empty if article post)",
  "author": {
    "name": "Display Name",
    "username": "handle",
